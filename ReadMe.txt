LC_DanielaCuza_ 2054562.ipynb -> Linear Classification on Wine Dataset
Dataset description
We will be working with a dataset on wines from the UCI machine learning repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine). It contains data for 178 instances. The dataset is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines.

The features in the dataset are:
Alcohol
Malic acid
Ash
Alcalinity of ash
Magnesium
Total phenols
Flavanoids
Nonflavanoid phenols
Proanthocyanins
Color intensity
Hue
OD280/OD315 of diluted wines



NN_DanielaCuza_2054562.ipynb -> Neural Networks for Classification, and Clustering
In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Neural Networks for image classification. We are going to use a dataset of small images of clothes and accessories, the Fashion MNIST. You can find more information regarding the dataset here: https://pravarmahajan.github.io/fashion/



SVM_DanielaCuza_2054562.ipynb -> SVM for classification, without and with kernels
In this notebook we are going to explore the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for image classification. We are going to use the famous MNIST dataset, that is a dataset of handwritten digits. We get the data from mldata.org, that is a public repository for machine learning data.

The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (i.e., 0, 1, ... 9). Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels and we can think of it as a vector of 28x28 = 784 numbers. Each number is an integer between 0 and 255. For each image we have the corresponding label (i.e., 0, 1, ..., 9).
